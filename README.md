#### How do I send out my email?
You'll first need to export your emails out of Blocks Edit: In the visual editor, after saving your updates, click **Export** at the top.

If you added images to your email, you'll have to host them somewhere. You can use the Blocks Edit [FTP integration](https://blocksedit.com/help/integrations/ftp-sftp-setup/) to upload to your site.

Otherwise, you'll [have the option](https://blocksedit.com/help/editor/export-to-email-provider/) to download your images which you will then need to upload manually to your host, and update the image paths in your email's HTML code.

To send out your email, you'll need to import your saved HTML to your email provider where you keep your email list.
